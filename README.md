## Overview

Welcome to Project 3! ðŸ‘‹

This project contains no new material. Rather, it's a good opportunity to sharpen your understanding of the core concepts of the first half of the course. It'll also give you practice with creating visualizations and websites, and will give you something concrete to put on your resume and show to potential employers!
